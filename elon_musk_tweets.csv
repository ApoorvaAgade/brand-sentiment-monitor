"1923808179336384909","People keep saying that ""batteries are bad"" because: 

""batteries don't create energy. batteries consume energy.""

Nothing. Creates. Energy.

Energy is neither created nor destroyed.

""Energy production"" and ""energy consumption"" are economic terms — not physics terms.

We don't actually produce or consume energy.
We direct energy.

The function of a battery is not upstream energy harvesting, but that's also not the function of a thermal generator.

The energy doesn't come from the generator.
The energy comes from the fuel.

We have to extract, refine, and transport that fuel. The generator is there to dispatch that chemical potential energy as electricity when it's needed.

That's what batteries do too, because:

Batteries ARE generators.

Batteries aren't electromechanical generators, but neither are photovoltaics or fuel cells.

Like chemical-fueled thermal generators, batteries convert chemical potential energy into electrical energy. The difference with batteries is that the process has fewer steps and is easily reversible.

Batteries provide a buffer, matching up supply and demand in time. They act as a cache, providing higher peak power at lower latency than a thermal generator of comparable mass or cost.

Batteries are an extremely useful tool for directing the flow of energy.

Batteries don't ""create energy""  — that's true.
Nothing. Creates. Energy.","en","Retweet","Jesse Peltan","JessePeltan","1821750","560","917","46","4109","521","2025-05-17 23:59:47","https://x.com/JessePeltan/status/1923808179336384909","<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>","","","",""

"1923401903595245647","Reflections: 

Several months ago, I started a website to search federal awards. 

The idea here was we'd find general waste, cut spending, execute on a vision of smaller government. And there's certainly a lot of bloat.  

However, what started out as waste-cutting quickly morphed into understanding why so much money is leaving the federal government and going into NGOs. These NGOs have been responsible for trafficking 20 million illegal immigrants into our country during the Biden years, many of them receiving benefits. 

And many of these NGOs also are the primary beneficiaries of foreign aid. 

And then I dig deeper - there is an entire ideology, an entire philosophy connecting this web of foreign aid and mass migration. 

This is the same ideology which led Congress to finance Ukraine, but not Hurricane Helene victims. 

This is the same ideology which led us into the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. 

This is the same ideology that George Soros outlined in his essay, ""Toward a New World Order: The Future of NATO.""

This is the same ideology which caused President Biden to declare 74 million supporters of President Trump the greatest threat to our Republic. 

To defeat government waste, we have to defeat this ideology. 

I never expected to set on this path. I don't know where it will head. But I will continue to do my part.","en","Quoted","DataRepublican (small r)","DataRepublican","37827661","2576","15048","839","53573","5800","2025-05-16 21:05:23","https://x.com/DataRepublican/status/1923401903595245647","<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>","","","",""

"1923124290142208069","FSD V13.2.8 ➡️ V13.2.9

First drive - 20mi, 1 hour behind wheel.

At this point, what can I say? I have been running these same routes since late V11 at end of 2023. I can’t believe what it was like then, and what it is like today. There is no greater way to measure Tesla than to sit in these cars watching this thing grow up. It’s incredible, and I’m so glad I got to watch it happen. 

My drive began with a single button tap on a touch screen. After that, I sat back with a smile on my face as I was driven home with smoothness and perfection greater than I’d ever be able to achieve myself. There is no turning force, no deceleration or acceleration force. Just floating home. Magic.

I don’t know how they’ve done this. I don’t know how they’ve made it improve this much and so quickly. I’m glad they did. 

I’ve been driving Teslas for two years, and still every single day, the thought of jumping in for my commute gives me a jolt of excitement. It hasn’t proven to be a novelty or something I’ve taken for granted. The vehicle just continues to get better and give you more to be excited about through time. Truly the best product I’ve ever owned of any kind. 

FSD is solved. It isn’t perfect everywhere yet, but it can be measured by the best experiences in the most well trained areas. It’s over.

I can’t wait for the rest of the world to start finding out","en","Retweet","Mike P","mikepat711","974509","207","824","21","3526","136","2025-05-16 02:42:15","https://x.com/mikepat711/status/1923124290142208069","<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>","","","",""

"1923152113078542565","I keep seeing a misconception that transmission lines are made out of copper.

For the vast majority of lines (especially overhead), that's not the case.

Most power lines are made from a steel core wrapped with aluminum conductors.
(that's why power lines look silvery and not coppery)

Steel provides the strength, and aluminum provides the conductivity.
(they both provide some of each but that's primarily how it works)

But isn't copper more conductive than aluminum?

For the same cross sectional area, aluminum is only about 60% as conductive as copper, but it's also only 30% as dense as copper.

For the same mass of metal, aluminum is about twice as conductive as copper.

Copper is better when you're space constrained (like in an electric motor), but aluminum is better when you're weight constrained.

Aluminum isn't just a cost saving measure (although it does cost 1/4th as much per kg). For a lot of applications, aluminum is actually better than copper.","en","Retweet","Jesse Peltan","JessePeltan","1437638","507","1413","71","7744","903","2025-05-16 04:32:48","https://x.com/JessePeltan/status/1923152113078542565","<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>","","","photo","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrBfRi-XAAAA0Ro.jpg"

"1922676592444088510","I see this misinterpreted all the time.

Elon is not literally proposing that we build a single giant solar farm to power the whole country.

It’s an illustration.

“what about all the transmission you’d need!??”

You’re missing the point entirely. Solar PV has a higher power density than New York City.

We don’t need to build massive transmission to use solar. In fact, one of the biggest advantages of solar PV is that solar energy is already wirelessly distributed.

Solar is one of the few technologies that can actually cut distribution costs. No centralized generator, even an SMR, is going to help with the distribution costs that make up 2/3 of T&D.

Solar + storage lets us bypass T&D constraints and generate electricity on site. 

With how slow T&D upgrades have been, solar + storage is essential for rapid electrification at scale.","en","Quoted","Jesse Peltan","JessePeltan","22913547","392","468","57","3135","339","2025-05-14 21:03:15","https://x.com/JessePeltan/status/1922676592444088510","<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>","","","",""

Here some supplementary information on the institutional ownership of Tesla, important for the upcoming shareholder vote:
Q3 and Q4 in 2024 saw significant increase in number of shares held by institutions. It' a bit lower at end of Q1 2025, BUT considerably higher than end of Q1 2024 (number important for last year's shareholder vote).
Now institutions hold 1,756,185,461 shares of the total of 3,221 bn, so 54.5% of all outstanding shares.  For some votes, Elon and Kimbal will need to recuse themselves, so that percentage will be even higher.
